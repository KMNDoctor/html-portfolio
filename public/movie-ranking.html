    <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
    <hr />
        <h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
            <p>
            One of the most hyped build up ever for a movie, even the trailers were insane.<br/>
            Was a lifetime long build up, don't know where it can go from now
            </p>
        <h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
            <p>
            A sort of emotional movie, that kinda of surprised me a lot.<br/>
            I related to it a lot too, and it was super cool how it was a more of a indie film<br/>
            It was a breath of fresh air compared to the other movies that came out at the time
            </p>
        <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
            <p>
            Honestly I need to rewatch it again, but I know this movie was amazing.<br/>
            The score, and visuals and just the camera work was phenomenal
